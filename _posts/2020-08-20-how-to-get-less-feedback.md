How to prevent people from sharing their feedback? What would make people less
honest and open?

- **Ignoring the feedback you receive.** If people think that their feedback is
  not going to change something, they won't bother giving it to you after a few
  tries.
- **Not giving feedback yourself.** The culture is shaped by the behaviour of
  everyone on the team. If you don't give feedback to others, it sets an example
  (this is especially true if people consider you a leader).
- **Telling someone that they are exaggerating** or are paranoid when they talk
  about a problem. It's a clear sign that their feedback is not important.
- **Explaining why someone is wrong** without trying to understand their
  perspective. It’s not about trying to convince the other person that you’re
  right. Even if you are, your goal should be to first understand their point of
  view.
- **Stopping the discussions and arguments**, calling them unproductive. This
  makes people question things they want to say. If someone has to think twice
  before saying something, there's a good chance they won't say it.
- **Blaming others when you hear the negative feedback** ("it's not my fault,
  it's ..."), explaining yourself when you receive negative feedback.
- ...

This exercise is an example of [**inversion
thinking**](https://jamesclear.com/inversion). Inversion is about thinking about
the *opposite* of what you want.

Rather than thinking "How to make people give more feedback?", think about
things that prevent people from giving it. Then, make sure that you never do the
things you listed. **Giving feedback (especially negative feedback) is extremely
hard! If you want to get more of it, make sure that you remove as many obstacles
as possible for them.**

One more closing thought. Despite what all the articles about the "feedback
culture" say, **receiving negative feedback will always be hard**. Hearing about
what you did wrong can be really uncomfortable - even if it's good for you in
the long run. *Giving* negative feedback is probably even harder. So don't be
fooled by people claiming that by creating a "feedback culture" you can make any
of it easy.

- [Atomic Habits by James
  Clear](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits) is an
  amazing resource on habits and human behaviour in general. One of the claims
  of the book is that if you want to change someone's (or yours) behaviour,
  motivation just doesn't work in the long run. What gets repeated is things
  that are easy to do. If you want more of something (here - feedback), remove
  as many blockers as possible and make it easier.
- Jessica Kerr wrote [a great short
  article](https://jessitron.com/2020/07/19/motivate-enable/) about the
  difference between *motivating* and *enabling.* If you want to see more of
  some behaviour from a team member, think how you can *enable* that behaviour,
  instead of thinking how to motivate that person.

  This article shows that the two biggest reasons for not enough feedback at
  work are **fear and a sense of futility.**
