Hello!

I'm Maciej Kaszubowski and I'm a software developer. I specialize in backend
development with a big focus on **Domain Driven Design**, **modular software design**,
**Elixir/OTP ecosystem**, and distributed systems.


I believe in holistic approach to problem solving and software development.
My job and my goal is to build amazing products and that requires a great team which takes
ownership and is not afraid of stepping out of their comfort zone. I draw a lot
of inspiration from **Systems Thinking** and **Complexity Theory**.
